    <h1>PUP History</h1>

    <p>The history of PUP may well parallel the nation's growth and development. As it met the needs of a 
        fledgling Philippine civil service under American rule forged from anvil of Spanish colonialism, so will it serve the rising expectations of the people in the 21st century...desirous now of reclaiming their rightful place in the community of independent nations. As it has withstood the test of time, so will it continue to pace contemporary Philippine history.

        Here are the highlights of its growth from a mere business school with an itinerant existence to the country's
        largest state university. Scroll down to view the PUP history timeline.</p>
